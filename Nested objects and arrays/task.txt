Precondition: The "input1.txt" file contains valid object in JSON format.



Task:

Implement a script that:

1. Reads an object from a file.

2. Finds the sum of all primitives contained in an object, as well as in nested objects and arrays:

The nested object can contain primitives, objects, arrays.
A nested array can also contain primitives, objects, arrays.
If the primitive is number, use it.
If the primitive is boolean, then true to convert to 1, false to 0.
Consider null and undefined primitives equal to 0.
The string, BigInt, symbol primitives will not be used.
3. Writes the result to the file "output.txt".



Note: Check "input.txt" and "output.txt" files in "Tests" tab as an example.
