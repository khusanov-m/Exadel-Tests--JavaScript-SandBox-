Precondition: The “input.txt” file contains a list of binary numbers separated by commas. The number of binary numbers in "input.txt" file is odd.



You need to use the binary numbers from “input.txt” file to generate a new binary number called the gamma.

Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the most common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers. 



Task:

Read data from “input.txt” file using node.js module fs.
Convert data to array
Write gamma number to “output.txt” file as a decimal.


Example: 

00100

11110

10110

10111

10101

01111

00111

11100

10000

11001

00010

01010



Description:

Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five 0 bits and seven 1 bits. Since the most common bit is 1, the first bit of the gamma rate is 1.
The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is 0, so the second bit of the gamma rate is 0.
The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are 1, 1, and 0, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are 110.
So, the gamma rate is the binary number 10110, or 22 in decimal.


Note: Check "input.txt" and "output.txt" files in "Tests" tab as an example.
